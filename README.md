# MATSim-Sweden

This repository contains an open MATSim scenario of Sweden. The focus in the model is on long-distance travel of cars and trucks.

The model was created using existing models (SAMPERS, SAMGODS) and other input sources (SCB, OSM) and is still a work in progress. 


To Run the model, check out this project, add it to your IDE (via Maven) and use the RunSweden class. Model output data from the basecase is also provided.
