# MATSim-Sweden

This repository contains an open MATSim scenario of Sweden. The focus in the model is on long-distance travel of cars and trucks.

The MATSim model for Sweden focuses on depicting long distance road transport in the country. It depicts both passenger and freight transport.
The model has been set up by converting results of the two existing static models (SAMGODS for freight and SAMPERS for passengers) into MATSim demand. The network is OSM based and the public transport supply origins from GTFS.

The primary goal of the model is to research the effects of a mass electrification of transport, including Electric Road Systems. But the model may also be used for different purposes.
