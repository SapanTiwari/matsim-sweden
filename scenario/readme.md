#Scenarios
Currently, there are two "base case" scenarios, that depict long-distance travel in Sweden on a typical work day.
##se_14.0.1
Is a 10% sample and should be used for more serious research. Visualising the scenario in VIA usually works, running the scenario on a standard machine requires ~20Gb of RAM.
##se_14.0.01
This is a 1% representation of the same scenario. Good to run on a laptop of for very rough analyses.
